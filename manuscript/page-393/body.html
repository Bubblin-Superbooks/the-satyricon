Faithless inconsistency! The gods must first resume<br>The charms that first they granted youth, that it might lovelier bloom!  
Poor wretch, but late thy locks did brighter glister<br>Than those of great Apollo or his sister!  
Now, smoother is thy crown than polished grasses<br>Or rounded mushrooms when a shower passes!  
In fear thou fliest the laughter-loving lasses.<br>That thou may’st know that Death is on his way,<br>Know that thy head is partly dead this day!”</p></blockquote><p><img class="overlay" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/the-satyricon/master/assets/images/%5D(images/p252.jpg" alt>)</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
