<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">weapons.<br>While Caesar in anger the swelling peaks treads down, winged rumor<br>In terror flies forth and on beating wings seeks the high summit<br>Of Palatine tall: every image she rocks with her message<br>Announcing this thunderbolt Roman! Already, the ocean<br>Is tossing his fleets! Now his cavalry, reeking with German<br>Gore, pours from the Alps! Slaughter, bloodshed, and weapons<br>The red panorama of war is unrolled to their vision!  
By terror their hearts are divided: two counsels perplex them!  
One chooses by land to seek flight: to another, the water<br>Appeals, and the sea than his own land is safer! Another<br>Will stand to his arms and advantage extort from Fate’s mandate.<br>The depth of their fear marks the length of their flight! In confusion<br>The people itself—shameful spectacle—driven by terror<br>Is led to abandon the city. Rome glories in fleeing!
