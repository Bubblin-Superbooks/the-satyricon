And the rivers sink into their channels;<br>Dragons, Hyrcanian tigers stand fast at my bidding!  
Why should I tell you of small things? The image of Luna<br>Drawn by my spells must descend, and Apollo, atremble<br>Backs up his horses and turns from his course at my order!  
Such is the power of my word! By the rites of a virgin<br>Quenched is the raging of bulls; and the sun’s daughter Circe<br>Changed and transfigured the crew of the wily Ulysses.<br>Proteus changes his form when his good pleasure dictates,<br>I, who am skilled in these arts, can the shrubs of Mount Ida<br>Plant in the ocean; turn rivers to flow up the mountains!”</p></blockquote></div> </div>
