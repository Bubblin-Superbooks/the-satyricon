Then, open thy thirsty dominions and summon fresh spirits;<br>For scarce will the ferryman’s strength be sufficient to carry<br>The souls of the dead in his skiff: ‘tis a fleet that is needed!  
Thou, Pallid Tisiphone, slake with wide ruin, thy thirsting<br>And tear ghastly wounds: mangled earth sinks to hell and the spirits.’”</p></blockquote></div> </div>
